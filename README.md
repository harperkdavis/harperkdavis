# Hello, I'm Harper K Davis

I am a programmer who is still in high school, and I really like making things. I made all of the games on [hked.live](https://hked.live/), featuring my good friend Nathan Chen, and a few others, notably [CENTORDLE](https://hked.live/centordle/), which has gained some traction around the web during the Wordle hype, even though I made it in one day. For my web games, I mostly use [p5](https://p5js.org/), which I am a big fan of, due to Processing being my first-ever text programming language.

Things that I am interested in:
- Procedural generation
- Old computers and technology
- Minimalist design

Many games of mine have taken inspiration from other games, as I find it very fun to develop my own spin on games I know.

## All my games

[Nathan Simulator](https://hked.live/nathansim)

Nathan Simulator was the first game I published on my website, and it started by me just messing around with p5js. It is a 2d action game where you fight enemies and make money. It actually came after a seperate physics based game that is now lost to time.

[Supergun](https://hked.live/supergun)

Supergun is the second of my web games. It takes inspiration from the Supergun in Nathan Simulator. It is a simple 3d shooter game, where one player has the Supergun, which shoots fast and has enough recoil to allow flight. Upon killing the Supergun player, you will recieve the supergun, so it becomes a one-versus-many type gamemode. It is quite laggy and buggy.
